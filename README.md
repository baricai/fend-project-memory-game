## Instructions

The project has some HTML and CSS styling that came with the files already since mentor mentioned that it would take time to code those from scratch.

The JS file has some standard start up code, where first we had to declare variables, and functions for Memory Game project. The HTML and CSS files, were a little modified at the end, but primarily the JavaScript file was the one that was designed basically from scratch.

At the end there's a pop up window specifying that the player has won the game, it's an interactive little window with the help from sweet alert that one of the mentors suggested to use.



For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
